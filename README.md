# The-League-SpringBoot-Edition
The League is an online 'web-parsing' web application that I created using Java (Springboot) and mySQL. The application can be found at this location: https://nba-the-league.herokuapp.com/

This application allows users to search up current NBA basketball players, and returns statistical information related to those respective players, such as points per game, rebounds per game, field-goal percentage, games played, etc. etc. 

The program makes use of the 'JSOUP' library to parse the internet and fetch this data (the application does not actually store any of this information).
